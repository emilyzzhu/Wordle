# Wordle-Clone
- To run the program, open the HTML file in a live server and in the terminal use the command "npm run start:backend"
- Once it's running you should be able to play Wordle as you would the original game, you can refresh to restart with a new word
    - Directions for playing:
        - Guess a 5 letter word and hit enter (must be a real word)
        - The tiles will flip and turn into a color, each color means something different:
            - grey = letter is not in the correct word
            - yellow = letter is in the correct word but you didn't put it in the right place
            - green = letter is in the correct word and is in the same place
        - Keep guessing using the colors as hints until you get the right word or you're out of guesses
- If you want to see the correct word inspect the page and the console should state what it is
